2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue`
3. Join our community discussions
4. Don't hesitate to ask questions!

## üîç Contribution Workflow

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

- Browse our [issue tracker](https://github.com/aytordev/system/issues)
- Search for existing issues before creating a new one
- If you find a relevant issue, comment to express interest
- If no issue exists, create one following our [issue guidelines](#-issue-management)

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click "Fork" at the top-right of the repository page
   - This creates your personal copy of the project

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/system.git
   cd system
   ```

3. **Configure Remotes**
   - Add the main repository as 'upstream':
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:aytordev/system.git
   ```
   - Verify remotes are set up correctly:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

4. **Create a Feature Branch**
   - Always work on a new branch for each feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b type/descriptive-name
   ```
   - Branch naming convention:
     - `feat/` for new features
     - `fix/` for bug fixes
     - `docs/` for documentation
     - `refactor/` for code improvements
     - `test/` for test additions

### 3. Make Your Changes

1. **Understand the Scope**
   - Focus on one logical change per PR
   - Keep changes small and reviewable (300-500 lines max per PR)
   - Reference related issues in your commit messages using `#issue-number`

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Make small, atomic commits that focus on a single change
   - Test your changes locally before committing
   - Update documentation alongside code changes
   - Follow our [code style guidelines](CODE_STYLE.md)
   - Run linters and formatters before committing

3. **Testing**
   - Add or update tests for all new functionality
   - Run the full test suite locally before pushing
   - Document any testing limitations or assumptions
   - Ensure all tests pass before opening a PR

4. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation with your changes
   - Add examples for new features or configurations
   - Clearly document any breaking changes
   - Keep README files up to date with usage examples

### 4. Branch Naming and Git Workflow

#### Branch Naming Convention

Create feature branches from the latest `main` branch using the following format:

```
type/description-in-kebab-case
```

**Examples:**
```
feat/add-user-authentication
fix/login-form-validation
docs/update-api-documentation
refactor/user-service
chore/update-dependencies
```

#### Creating a New Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on the latest main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b type/descriptive-branch-name

# Push the branch to your fork
git push -u origin type/descriptive-branch-name
```

### 5. Commit with Gitmoji

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification with [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to create meaningful, consistent commit messages. Always use gitmoji codes (e.g., `:sparkles:`) instead of emoji images.

#### Commit Message Structure

```
:gitmoji: type(scope): concise description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Important:** Always use gitmoji codes (e.g., `:sparkles:`) in your commit messages, not emoji characters. This ensures consistency across different systems and editors.

#### Gitmoji Types and Usage

| Type | Gitmoji Code | When to Use | Example |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | `:sparkles:` | New features or significant additions | `:sparkles: feat(auth): add MFA support` |
| `fix` | `:bug:` | Bug fixes | `:bug: fix(api): handle null user edge case` |
| `docs` | `:memo:` | Documentation changes | `:memo: docs: update API reference` |
| `style` | `:art:` | Code style/formatting changes | `:art: style: format with prettier` |
| `refactor` | `:recycle:` | Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features | `:recycle: refactor(auth): simplify token validation` |
| `perf` | `:zap:` | Performance improvements | `:zap: perf(db): optimize query performance` |
| `test` | `:white_check_mark:` | Adding or modifying tests | `:white_check_mark: test(utils): add test coverage` |
| `chore` | `:wrench:` | Build process or auxiliary tool changes | `:wrench: chore(deps): update dependencies` |
| `ci` | `:construction_worker:` | CI configuration changes | `:construction_worker: ci: add GitHub Actions workflow` |
| `build` | `:package:` | Build system or external dependencies | `:package: build: update webpack config` |
| `revert` | `:rewind:` | Revert previous commit | `:rewind: revert: revert auth changes` |
| `wip` | `:construction:` | Work in progress | `:construction: wip: implement payment flow` |
| `security` | `:lock:` | Security-related changes | `:lock: security: upgrade vulnerable packages` |
| `i18n` | `:globe_with_meridians:` | Internationalization/localization | `:globe_with_meridians: i18n: add Spanish translation` |

#### Commit Message Components

1. **Gitmoji**
   - Always start with an appropriate Gitmoji
   - Use the most specific emoji that matches the change
   - Don't use multiple emojis in a single commit

2. **Type (Required)**
   - Must be one of the standard types listed above
   - Use lowercase
   - Be specific and consistent

3. **Scope (Optional)**
   - Enclosed in parentheses
   - Describes the section of the codebase affected
   - Examples: `(auth)`, `(api)`, `(ui)`, `(config)`
   - Use `*` for changes affecting multiple scopes

4. **Description (Required)**
   - Use imperative, present tense ("add" not "added" or "adds")
   - Don't capitalize the first letter
   - No period at the end
   - Keep it under 72 characters

5. **Body (Optional)**
   - Separate from subject with a blank line
   - Use imperative, present tense
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - Wrap at 72 characters
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes

6. **Footer (Optional)**
   - Separate from body with a blank line
   - Reference issues with keywords (e.g., `Closes #123`)
   - Document breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:`
   - Include migration notes if needed

#### Advanced Examples

**Feature with Body and Footer**
```
‚ú® feat(auth): add OAuth2 with GitHub

   - Split large features into smaller, reviewable commits

2. **Meaningful Messages**
   - Be clear and descriptive
   - Explain why the change is being made
   - Reference relevant issues or discussions

3. **Consistency**
   - Follow the same format across all commits
   - Use the same terminology
   - Keep the style uniform

4. **Review Before Committing**
   - Stage changes selectively with `git add -p`
   - Review staged changes with `git diff --cached`
   - Write a clear, descriptive message

5. **Interactive Rebase**
   - Clean up your commit history before pushing
   - Squash fixup commits
   - Reorder commits logically
   - Rewrite messages for clarity

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå **Vague Messages**
```
‚ùå git commit -m "fix bug"
‚úÖ git commit -m "üêõ fix(auth): handle null token in middleware"
```

‚ùå **Multiple Changes in One Commit**
```
‚ùå feat: add user auth and update styles
‚úÖ feat(auth): implement JWT authentication
‚úÖ style(ui): update login form styles
```

‚ùå **Inconsistent Formatting**
```
‚ùå FIX: Login issue
‚úÖ üêõ fix(login): resolve authentication timeout
```

#### Tools and Automation

1. **Commitizen**
   ```bash
   # Install
   npm install -g commitizen
   
   # Use interactive commit helper
   git cz
   ```

2. **Commitlint**
   - Validates commit messages against conventional format
   - Can be integrated with Husky for pre-commit hooks

3. **Git Hooks**
   - Use `prepare-commit-msg` to suggest emojis
   - Add `commit-msg` hook to validate format
   - Use `pre-push` to run tests

4. **Changelog Generation**
   - `standard-version`: Automate versioning and CHANGELOG generation
   - `semantic-release`: Fully automated package publishing

#### Workflow Integration

### Example Workflows

#### 1. Starting a New Feature

```bash
# Make sure you have the latest changes
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feat/user-profile
