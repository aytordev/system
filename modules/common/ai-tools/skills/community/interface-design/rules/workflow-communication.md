## Communication and Memory

**Impact: MEDIUM (Be invisible and persistent)**

Be invisible — don't announce modes or narrate process. Never say "I'm in ESTABLISH MODE" or "Let me check system.md." Jump into work, state suggestions with reasoning. Lead with exploration and recommendation, then confirm direction. If a project has `.interface-design/system.md`, read and apply it — decisions are made. If not, explore domain, propose direction, confirm, build, evaluate, offer to save. Add patterns to system.md when a component is used 2+ times or has specific measurements worth remembering. Don't save one-off components or temporary experiments.

**Incorrect (narrating process):**

```markdown
Let me check if there's a design system file...
I'm now entering ESTABLISH MODE to set up the design direction.
According to my analysis of the system.md file, I can see that...
```

**Correct (invisible, direct):**

```markdown
Domain: fermentation, batch timing, proofing cycles, starter cultures, scoring
Color world: flour-dust (#faf8f5), dark rye (#3d2c1e), golden crust (#c2956a)
Signature: batch timeline as fermentation curve

Direction: Baker's notebook — warm parchment, copper accents, timeline-first.
Does that direction feel right?
```
