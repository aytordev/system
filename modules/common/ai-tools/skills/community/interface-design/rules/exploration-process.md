## Product Domain Exploration

**Impact: HIGH (Catch defaults before they become design)**

Before proposing any direction, produce all four required outputs. **Domain:** Concepts, metaphors, vocabulary from this product's world — not features, territory. Minimum 5. **Color world:** What colors exist naturally in this domain? If this product were a physical space, what would you see? List 5+. **Signature:** One element that could only exist for THIS product. **Defaults:** 3 obvious choices you're rejecting — visual AND structural. Your proposal must reference all four. The test: remove the product name from your proposal — could someone identify what it's for?

**Incorrect (skipping exploration):**

```markdown
Direction: Clean dashboard with blue accent, sidebar navigation,
card-based layout with metrics.
```

**Correct (full domain exploration):**

```markdown
Domain: fermentation, batch timing, pH curves, starter cultures,
sourdough scoring, proofing cycles
Color world: flour-dusted surfaces (#faf8f5), dark rye (#3d2c1e),
golden crust (#c2956a), ceramic white (#f5f0eb), copper (#b87333)
Signature: batch timeline as a fermentation curve, not a progress bar
Rejecting: blue accent (→ copper), card grid (→ timeline-first),
generic metrics (→ dough readiness indicators)

Direction: A baker's notebook. Warm parchment surfaces, copper accents
that reference equipment, timeline-first layout following dough from
mixing through proofing to baking.
```
