## Intent First

**Impact: CRITICAL (Design from specifics not assumptions)**

Before touching code, answer three questions — not in your head, out loud. **Who is this human?** Not "users" — the actual person, their context, their moment. **What must they accomplish?** Not "use the dashboard" — the verb. **What should this feel like?** Not "clean and modern" — words that mean something. If you cannot answer these with specifics, stop and ask the user. Do not guess. Do not default.

**Incorrect (vague intent):**

```markdown
Intent: Users need a clean, modern dashboard
Feel: Professional and intuitive
```

**Correct (specific intent):**

```markdown
Intent: A bakery owner at 6am, checking overnight online orders before
the morning rush. They need to see what to bake first.
Feel: Warm like a notebook — not a spreadsheet. Calm, not urgent.
```
