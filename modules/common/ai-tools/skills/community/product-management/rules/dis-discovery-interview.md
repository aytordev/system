## Discovery Interview Prep

**Impact: CRITICAL (Leading questions produce false signal that drives wrong product decisions)**

Discovery Interview Prep applies Mom Test principles to plan customer interviews: ask about past behavior not hypothetical preferences, never pitch the idea, and treat every compliment as a data-quality failure. Use it before any customer conversation where you're testing a problem hypothesis or exploring a job-to-be-done. Do not use it for usability testing or concept validation — those require different question types. The interview guide is not a script; it's a set of anchors that keep you from drifting into confirmation bias.

**Incorrect (leading questions, hypothetical-focused):**

```markdown
## Interview Guide: Project Management Tool

1. Would you use a tool that automatically prioritizes your tasks?
2. How important is AI-powered scheduling to you? (1–5)
3. Do you think our dashboard concept would help your team?
4. What features would you want in an ideal tool?
5. Would you pay $20/month for this?
```

**Correct (Mom Test-compliant, behavior-anchored):**

```markdown
## Interview Guide: Project Management | Goal: Understand task overload problem

**Opening (set context, not pitch):**
"I'm trying to understand how you manage your work — not sell you anything.
Tell me about last week. What did your Monday morning look like?"

**Behavior questions (specific, past-tense):**
- "Walk me through the last time a deadline caught you off guard. What happened?"
- "When you sit down to start work, how do you decide what to do first?"
- "What did you actually do the last time you felt overwhelmed by your task list?"
- "What tools were open on your screen at that moment?"

**Dig on pain (not validation-seeking):**
- "How often does that happen?" (frequency = severity proxy)
- "What have you tried to fix it?" (existing solutions reveal real motivation)
- "Why didn't that work?" (gaps reveal the actual problem)

**Close:**
"Is there anything I didn't ask that I should have?"

**Do NOT ask:** "Would you use X?" / "What features do you want?" / "Is this a problem?"
```
