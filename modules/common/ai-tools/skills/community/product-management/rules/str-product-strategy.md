## Product Strategy Session

**Impact: CRITICAL (Skipping strategy orchestration produces a roadmap without a foundation)**

The Product Strategy Session is a 2–4 week orchestrated process that sequences five component frameworks in order: positioning statement, problem framing, problem statement, market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), and roadmap planning. Each phase must complete before the next begins — outputs from earlier phases are inputs to later ones. Use this when starting a new product, pivoting an existing one, or when leadership alignment is visibly broken. Do not run it as a one-day offsite; the inter-phase synthesis is where the strategic clarity emerges.

**Incorrect (phases collapsed into a single session):**

```markdown
Strategy Day Agenda (8 hours):
9am  — Brainstorm target customers
10am — Define differentiators
11am — Size the market
1pm  — Build the roadmap
4pm  — Present to leadership

Output: 47-slide deck, no shared written artifacts, three conflicting interpretations
```

**Correct (sequenced, artifact-driven over multiple weeks):**

```markdown
Week 1: Positioning
- Run Positioning Workshop → produce signed-off Positioning Statement
- Artifact: "For [target] that [need], we are a [category] that [benefit]..."

Week 2: Problem Clarity
- Run Problem Framing Canvas → produce Reframed Problem Statement
- Run Problem Statement workshop → 3 validated persona-level statements

Week 3: Market Validation
- Run TAM/SAM/SOM Calculator → market size with cited methodology
- Go/no-go gate: Is the SOM large enough to justify the strategy?

Week 4: Roadmap Planning
- Translate validated strategy into 12-month roadmap with sequenced bets
- Each initiative links back to positioning differentiator or problem statement
```
