## Customer Journey Mapping Workshop

**Impact: CRITICAL (Facilitation failures produce maps that no one owns or acts on)**

A Customer Journey Mapping Workshop is a guided collaborative session that builds a shared journey map with cross-functional stakeholders using adaptive facilitation — asking the right question at each stage rather than presenting a pre-built map. Use it when teams have siloed views of the customer experience or when a map will require organizational buy-in to act on. Do not use it as a way to validate a map you've already drawn; if the output is predetermined, the workshop erodes trust. Adaptive questions that surface disagreement are more valuable than smooth consensus.

**Incorrect (presenter mode, no real facilitation):**

```markdown
## Journey Mapping Workshop Agenda

9:00 — PM presents current journey map to team
9:30 — Team reviews and adds sticky notes
10:00 — PM synthesizes feedback
10:30 — Final map shared in Confluence

Outcome: Updated journey map document
```

**Correct (adaptive facilitation with stage-by-stage questions):**

```markdown
## Journey Mapping Workshop | 90 min | Cross-functional team

**Setup (10 min):** Agree on persona + goal. Write it on the board.
"We are mapping [Persona] trying to [Goal]. Not all journeys. This one."

**Stage Excavation (60 min):** For each stage, facilitator asks in order:
1. "What is the customer actually DOING at this point? Physical action?"
2. "What are they thinking — what question is in their head?"
3. "How are they feeling? Give it a number 1–5." (Write it large.)
4. "Where does our team lose the thread here — who owns this moment?"
5. "What would make this a 5/5 moment? Be specific."

**Divergence prompt (if team agrees too fast):**
"That was fast — who sees this stage differently? What did we miss?"

**Synthesis (20 min):** Circle the two lowest emotional scores.
"These are our design targets. What do we commit to testing first?"

**Output:** Jointly owned map + 2 prioritized pain points with named owners.
```
