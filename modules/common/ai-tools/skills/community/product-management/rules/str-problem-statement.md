## Problem Statement

**Impact: CRITICAL (Requirements written without a grounded problem statement optimize for the wrong outcome)**

Frame a customer problem using the five-part structure: "I am [persona] trying to [goal] but [barrier] because [root cause] which makes me feel [emotional impact]." This format forces specificity about who experiences the problem, what they are trying to accomplish, and why the current situation fails them — without presupposing a solution. Use it to align stakeholders on the problem before any solution discussion. Do not synthesize without real user evidence; each component must be traceable to research data or direct quotes.

**Incorrect (solution-framed, persona-free):**

```markdown
Problem: The app needs a better onboarding flow because users are dropping off.
We should add a tutorial wizard and tooltips.
```

**Correct (evidence-backed, structured format):**

```markdown
I am a newly hired revenue operations analyst
trying to get my first monthly pipeline report out within my first two weeks
but I cannot connect our CRM data to the reporting tool without IT help
because the integration requires admin credentials I'm not authorized to have,
which makes me feel like I'm failing at a basic part of my job before I've even started.

Source: 6/8 onboarding interview participants described a version of this barrier.
