## Discovery Process

**Impact: CRITICAL (Skipping discovery phases leads to building solutions for unvalidated problems)**

The Discovery Process is a complete 3–4 week cycle structured in four sequential phases: frame the problem, conduct research, synthesize findings, and validate the opportunity. Use it at the start of any significant product investment before committing engineering capacity. Do not compress it into a single sprint or skip the synthesis phase — insights that are not synthesized across participants produce contradictory outputs that stall alignment. Each phase has a defined exit criterion; do not advance until it is met.

**Incorrect (undifferentiated "research sprint," no structure):**

```markdown
## Q2 Discovery

Week 1–2: Talk to customers
Week 3: Write up notes
Week 4: Share findings with team

Output: Slide deck with quotes
Next step: Start building the most-requested feature
```

**Correct (phased discovery with exit criteria):**

```markdown
## Discovery Process: [Opportunity Name] | 4 weeks

### Phase 1: Frame (Days 1–3)
- Write the problem hypothesis: "We believe [persona] struggles with [problem]
  in [context], which causes [consequence]."
- Define research questions (max 5). What must be true for this to be worth building?
- Identify participant types needed. Recruit 8–12 people.
- **Exit criterion:** Team alignment on problem hypothesis + research questions.

### Phase 2: Research (Days 4–14)
- Run discovery interviews (Mom Test protocol) — 8 minimum.
- Observe in context where possible (1 session = 3 interviews of insight).
- Log raw observations, not interpretations, during sessions.
- **Exit criterion:** No new themes emerging after last 3 interviews (saturation).

### Phase 3: Synthesize (Days 15–17)
- Affinity cluster across all sessions independently, then together.
- Identify patterns: frequency × severity matrix for each pain point.
- Write 3–5 insight statements: "When [context], [persona] [behavior] because [belief]."
- **Exit criterion:** Insights reviewed and challenged by non-research team member.

### Phase 4: Validate (Days 18–21)
- Map top insights to opportunity hypothesis.
- Identify the ONE riskiest assumption. Design a PoL probe to test it.
- Decision gate: proceed / pivot / park — with documented rationale.
- **Exit criterion:** Go/no-go decision made with evidence, not conviction.
