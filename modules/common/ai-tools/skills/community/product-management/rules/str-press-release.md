## Press Release (Working Backwards)

**Impact: CRITICAL (Building before writing the press release causes scope creep and vision drift)**

Amazon's Working Backwards method requires writing a customer-facing press release before a single line of code is written, forcing clarity on what success looks like from the outside. Structure it with: headline, subheadline, launch date, problem paragraph, solution paragraph, internal quote, customer quote, and a clear call to action. Do not use it as actual marketing — it is a decision-forcing document to expose assumption gaps and misaligned expectations before they become expensive. If the team cannot write it, the vision is not clear enough to build.

**Incorrect (feature-focused, no customer outcome):**

dashboard with 14 new chart types, a redesigned navigation bar, and API rate limit
increases. The engineering team worked for six months on these improvements.

**Correct (outcome-focused, customer-centric):**
