## Company Research

**Impact: CRITICAL (Missing competitive context leads to positioning blind spots)**

Company research is a structured deep-dive covering business model, market position, product strategy, and competitive dynamics — not a surface-level Wikipedia summary. Use it before entering a new market, evaluating a competitor, or validating strategic direction. Do not use it as a one-time exercise; competitive landscapes shift and research should be refreshed quarterly. The output should reveal the "why" behind a company's moves, not just the "what."

**Incorrect (surface-level, no insight):**

```markdown
## Salesforce Competitive Analysis

- CRM software company
- Founded 1999, public company
- Products: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud
- Competitors: HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics
- Revenue: ~$31B
```

**Correct (business model + strategic dynamics):**

```markdown
## Salesforce Competitive Analysis

**Business Model:** Platform lock-in via deep CRM data + AppExchange ecosystem.
Revenue = subscriptions (80%) + professional services (20%). NRR ~115%.

**Market Position:** Enterprise default for complex sales orgs. Losing SMB to HubSpot
on ease-of-use. Defending with Starter Suite (simplified UX) + AI (Einstein).

**Product Strategy:** Acquisitions to extend data surface (Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft).
Bet: AI requires unified data — own the data layer to own AI outcomes.

**Competitive Dynamics:** HubSpot attacks from below on UX/price. Microsoft attacks
from above via M365 bundle. Primary moat is switching cost, not product superiority.

**Strategic Implication for Us:** SMB segment is contested. Competing on simplicity
beats competing on features. Avoid the enterprise segment without differentiated data.
