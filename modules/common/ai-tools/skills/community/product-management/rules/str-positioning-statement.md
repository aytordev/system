## Positioning Statement

**Impact: CRITICAL (Vague positioning makes every downstream decision arbitrary)**

Use Geoffrey Moore's framework to define exactly who you serve, what problem you solve, and how you differ from alternatives. Apply this before writing any marketing copy, roadmap, or press release — it anchors all downstream decisions. Do not use it as a tagline or elevator pitch; it is an internal alignment tool. The six-part template must be filled with specific, falsifiable claims — not generic superlatives.

**Incorrect (generic and unfalsifiable):**

```markdown
For businesses that need better software, our platform is an all-in-one solution
that helps teams work smarter. Unlike competitors, we are faster and easier to use.
```

**Correct (specific, structured, and testable):**

```markdown
For mid-market SaaS finance teams (50–500 employees) that struggle to close the
books in under five days, our product is a financial close automation platform
that reduces close time by 40% through automated reconciliation workflows.
Unlike spreadsheet-based processes and legacy ERP modules, we provide real-time
audit trails and one-click variance explanations without requiring IT involvement.
