## Customer Journey Map

**Impact: CRITICAL (Without journey maps, teams optimize touchpoints instead of experiences)**

A Customer Journey Map visualizes the end-to-end experience a specific persona has while pursuing a goal, using the NNGroup methodology: stages, actions, thoughts, feelings, pain points, and opportunities. Use it to surface cross-functional gaps and emotional low points that no single team owns. Do not use it as a generic process diagram or a one-persona-fits-all artifact — segment by persona and goal. The feelings row is not optional; emotional friction predicts churn better than functional friction.

**Incorrect (missing emotional layer, too generic):**

```markdown
## User Journey: Purchase Flow

Stage 1: Awareness → User sees ad
Stage 2: Consideration → User visits website
Stage 3: Purchase → User buys product
Stage 4: Delivery → User receives item

Pain point: Checkout is slow.
```

**Correct (NNGroup structure with emotional truth):**

```markdown
## Journey Map: First-Time Buyer | Goal: Purchase a gift under $50

### Stage 1: Awareness
- **Action:** Sees Instagram ad, taps to website
- **Thought:** "Do they have something for my sister?"
- **Feeling:** Curious, slightly skeptical (2/5)
- **Pain Point:** No gift category or occasion filter visible
- **Opportunity:** Add "Shop by Occasion" entry point on landing page

### Stage 2: Browse
- **Action:** Searches "birthday," scans 40+ results
- **Thought:** "How do I know what's good quality?"
- **Feeling:** Overwhelmed, anxious (1/5) — emotional LOW POINT
- **Pain Point:** No social proof at browse level; reviews buried on PDPs
- **Opportunity:** Surface star ratings + "bestseller" tags in grid view

### Stage 3: Purchase
- **Action:** Adds item, begins checkout
- **Thought:** "I hope this arrives in time."
- **Feeling:** Cautiously optimistic (3/5)
- **Pain Point:** Estimated delivery shown only after payment
- **Opportunity:** Show delivery estimate on PDP and cart
```
