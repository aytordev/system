## Jobs to Be Done

**Impact: CRITICAL (Feature-first thinking solves the wrong problem at the wrong level)**

Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) reframes product thinking around what customers are trying to accomplish, not what they say they want — covering functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the job. Use it when discovery interviews reveal that customers struggle to articulate needs or when your roadmap keeps filling up with features that don't move retention. Do not treat JTBD as a replacement for personas; they answer different questions — personas describe who, JTBD describes why. The job statement format ("When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]") is the deliverable, not a persona narrative.

**Incorrect (feature-centric, no job context):**

```markdown
## Customer Needs Analysis

Users want:
- Better search functionality
- Faster load times
- Dark mode
- Mobile app
- More integrations with Slack and Notion

Priority: Build the most-requested features first.
```

**Correct (JTBD with all three dimensions):**

```markdown
## Jobs to Be Done: Project Management for Independent Consultants

**Functional Job:**
"When I'm about to start my week, I want to see exactly what I must deliver
and to whom, so I can protect client relationships without keeping it all in my head."

**Emotional Job:**
"When I'm juggling multiple clients, I want to feel in control (not reactive),
so I can end the day feeling like a competent professional, not someone who's drowning."

**Social Job:**
"When a client asks for a status update, I want to respond immediately with specifics,
so I appear organized and trustworthy — not like I'm scrambling to check notes."

**Job Insight:**
The core job is not 'task management' — it's 'professional credibility maintenance.'
Features that make the consultant look good to clients outrank features that
help them manage tasks internally. Prioritize: client-facing status views, fast
update sharing, professional-looking exports. Deprioritize: internal kanban improvements.
