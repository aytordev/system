## Positioning Workshop

**Impact: CRITICAL (Positioning built in isolation breaks under cross-functional scrutiny)**

Run this as a guided multi-turn session to build positioning collaboratively, surfacing disagreements before they become launch blockers. Use adaptive questions to probe target market clarity, competitive landscape assumptions, and the strength of the differentiator claim. Do not treat this as a one-hour meeting — each phase (target, problem, alternatives, differentiator) requires evidence, not opinion. Stop and probe whenever a stakeholder gives a generic answer.

**Incorrect (skipping discovery phases):**

```markdown
Workshop output after 30 minutes:
- Target: "Enterprise companies"
- Problem: "They need efficiency"
- Differentiator: "We're easier to use and have better support"
→ Approved by team. Moving to launch copy.
```

**Correct (evidence-grounded, phase-by-phase):**

```markdown
Phase 1 — Target Market:
Q: Who specifically buys today? Who rejects us?
Finding: Primary buyer = VP Finance at Series B SaaS (not IT, not CEO)

Phase 2 — Problem Validation:
Q: What does the buyer say in their own words?
Finding: "I can't trust the numbers my team gives me at month-end"

Phase 3 — Competitive Alternatives:
Q: What do they do today without us?
Finding: Excel + Slack threads + manual Salesforce exports

Phase 4 — Differentiator Test:
Q: Can we prove this claim with data?
Finding: 3 case studies show 40% close-time reduction — claim is defensible
```
