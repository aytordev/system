## PESTEL Analysis

**Impact: MEDIUM (Ignoring macro-environmental factors causes strategy to break on forces the team never modeled)**

A PESTEL analysis maps six external factor categories — Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal — against each factor's impact level (high/medium/low) and likelihood (certain/probable/possible) to surface threats and opportunities for product strategy. Run it at the start of annual planning, when entering a new market, or after a macro shock. Do not run it as a brainstorm without anchoring each factor to a concrete product or go-to-market decision — factors with no strategic implication should be logged but not acted on.

**Incorrect (factor list with no impact mapping or strategic response):**

## PESTEL — HR Tech Product

Political: government regulations changing
Economic: recession concerns
Social: remote work trends continuing
Technological: AI is advancing fast
Environmental: sustainability matters more
Legal: GDPR and data privacy rules

Conclusion: lots of external factors to watch
```

**Correct (factor mapped to impact, likelihood, and strategic implication):**

## PESTEL Analysis — HR Tech Product (Q1 2026)

| Factor        | Specific Force                          | Impact | Likelihood | Strategic Implication                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Political     | EU AI Act enforcement begins H2 2026    | High   | Certain    | Audit automated decision features before June      |
| Economic      | SMB hiring freeze in core segment       | High   | Probable   | Shift ICP toward enterprise; revisit pricing tiers |
| Social        | 4-day workweek adoption rising in EU    | Medium | Probable   | Add scheduling flexibility to roadmap backlog      |
| Technological | LLM cost dropping 10x every 18 months   | High   | Certain    | Accelerate AI-assisted workflows; revisit build/buy|
| Environmental | ESG reporting now expected by investors | Low    | Probable   | No product action; monitor for enterprise segment  |
| Legal         | GDPR Article 22 on automated decisions  | High   | Certain    | Legal review required before Q3 product launch     |

Prioritized actions:
1. Legal: schedule EU AI Act compliance review (owner: PM + Legal, due May)
2. Economic: update ICP definition and CAC model for enterprise segment (due Q2 planning)
3. Technological: spike on LLM-assisted offer letter generation (2-week timebox)
