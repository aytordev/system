# Product Management

Battle-tested PM frameworks distilled into actionable rules covering the full product lifecycle.

**Use for:** Discovery research, strategy definition, PRD development, user story writing, prioritization, roadmap planning, financial analysis, workshop facilitation.

**Not for:** Engineering implementation, code review, infrastructure design. Use domain-specific skills for those.
