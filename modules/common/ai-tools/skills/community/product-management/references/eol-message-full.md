# End-of-Life Message — Full Framework

## Purpose

Craft a clear, empathetic End-of-Life (EOL) message that communicates product or
feature discontinuation while maintaining customer trust. An effective EOL
message acknowledges the disruption, explains the rationale in customer-benefit
terms, provides a concrete transition plan, and positions the replacement.

This is not a terse shutdown notice. It is a customer-centric communication that
acknowledges loss while framing the change as progress.

## When to Use

- Discontinuing a product, feature, or service
- Migrating customers from a legacy platform to a new one
- Sunsetting an acquired product after consolidation
- Deprecating a technology stack or API version

## When NOT to Use

- For minor feature tweaks (do not over-communicate small changes)
- Before you have a transition plan (communicate after you know how you will
  support customers, not before)
- If you are hoping customers will not notice (be transparent)

## The 9-Part EOL Framework

Every EOL message must cover these sections in order:

| Section               | Role                                                       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Company Context    | Who you are and your commitment to customers               |
| 2. Announcement       | What is being discontinued and what replaces it            |
| 3. Rationale          | Why this decision benefits customers (not just the business) |
| 4. Product Context    | What the product was and who it served                     |
| 5. Customer Impact    | How this affects users — acknowledge the disruption        |
| 6. Transition Solution| What replaces it and how it improves on the old            |
| 7. Support Measures   | How you will help customers migrate                        |
| 8. Timeline           | Key dates and milestones with sufficient lead time         |
| 9. Call to Action     | Clear next steps and contact information                   |

## Complete Template

```markdown
## Company Context

**We are:** [Company name and relationship to the product]
- [Commitment to customers]
- [Product evolution context]
- [Future vision]

## Announcement

We are discontinuing [product name] on [date] and migrating all customers to
[replacement product name].

## Rationale

**Because:**
- [Reason 1 — framed as customer benefit]
- [Reason 2 — framed as customer benefit]
- [Reason 3 — framed as customer benefit]

**Which means for you:**
- [Concrete benefit 1]
- [Concrete benefit 2]
- [Concrete benefit 3]

## Current Product Context

**Our product** [name]
- **is a** [brief description of primary function]
- **that has served** [target customer] for [duration]
- **by providing** [key benefits it offered]

## Customer Impact

**We understand this may affect you by:**
- [Impact 1 on operations or processes]
- [Impact 2 on operations or processes]
- [Impact 3 if applicable]

## Transition Solution

**For** [target customer affected]
- **that currently use** [product being phased out]
- [replacement product]
- **is a** [category definition]
- **that** [benefit statement — continuity + improvements]

**Like** [old product], [replacement] **provides** [maintained benefits]
**while also offering** [new benefits and improvements]

## Support and Next Steps

**To ensure a smooth transition, we will:**
- [Support measure 1 — e.g., 1-on-1 migration assistance]
- [Support measure 2 — e.g., automatic workflow migration]
- [Support measure 3 — e.g., discount for existing customers]

## Timeline

- [Date 1]: [Milestone — e.g., migration tool available]
- [Date 2]: [Milestone — e.g., product becomes read-only]
- [Date 3]: [Milestone — e.g., full shutdown and data export deadline]

## Call to Action

- [Clear next step — e.g., log in to start migration wizard]
- [Contact info — e.g., support@company.com or phone number]
```

## Worked Example

```markdown
## Announcement

We are discontinuing Acme Workflows Classic on December 31, 2026, and migrating
all customers to Acme Workflows Pro.

## Rationale

**Because:**
- Classic runs on infrastructure that limits performance and scalability
- Pro is built on modern technology enabling 3x faster automation
- Consolidating to one platform lets us invest 100% of engineering in features
  you have requested

**Which means for you:**
- 3x faster automation execution
- 50+ new integrations with tools you already use
- Real-time collaboration and mobile app access

## Customer Impact

**We understand this may affect you by:**
- Requiring time to migrate workflows from Classic to Pro
- Learning new features and interface changes
- Updating integrations or API connections if you customized workflows

## Support and Next Steps

**To ensure a smooth transition, we will:**
- Provide 1-on-1 migration assistance for all customers
- Automatically migrate your workflows (with your approval)
- Offer a 3-month discount on Pro for existing Classic customers

## Timeline

- March 1, 2026: Migration tool available
- September 1, 2026: Classic becomes read-only
- December 31, 2026: Classic fully discontinued; data export deadline
```

## Writing Rules

1. **Lead with empathy, not business rationale.** "We're discontinuing to reduce
   costs" makes customers feel like collateral damage. Frame around their benefit.

2. **Be specific about dates.** "Soon" is not a timeline. Customers cannot plan
   without concrete milestones.

3. **Never send without a support plan.** "You'll need to migrate — good luck"
   causes churn. Offer migration assistance, tools, and discounts.

4. **Acknowledge the disruption explicitly.** Jumping from announcement to
   replacement without acknowledging impact feels dismissive.

5. **Give sufficient lead time.** 6-12 months is typical for major product EOL.
   Anything under 3 months creates panic and anger.

6. **Include a data export deadline.** Customers need to know when they lose
   access to their data. This is often the highest-anxiety item.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode              | Example                                              | Fix                                                       |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Business-centric rationale | "We're consolidating to reduce costs"               | Frame as customer benefit: "investing 100% in features you requested" |
| Vague timeline             | "Product X will be discontinued soon"               | Specific dates: "March 1: migration tool. Dec 31: shutdown" |
| No support plan            | "Migrate to Product Y. Good luck!"                  | Offer: 1-on-1 help, auto-migration, discounts, training   |
| Ignoring customer impact   | Jumps from announcement to replacement               | Explicitly list how this affects their operations          |
| Terse or defensive tone    | "Due to low usage, we're shutting down"              | Empathetic and forward-looking: "focusing on the future"  |
| Blaming customers          | "Not enough users adopted this feature"              | Take ownership of the decision and frame it positively    |
| Missing data export info   | No mention of when data access ends                  | Include explicit data export deadline and tools           |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Rationale is framed as customer benefit, not business cost savings
- [ ] Timeline includes specific dates for every milestone
- [ ] Customer impact is explicitly acknowledged before presenting the replacement
- [ ] Support measures are concrete (not "we'll help you transition")
- [ ] Data export deadline is clearly stated
- [ ] Replacement is positioned with continuity (what stays the same) and improvement
- [ ] Lead time is at least 6 months for major product EOL
- [ ] Tone is empathetic and forward-looking, not defensive or terse
- [ ] Call to action is singular and specific
- [ ] Contact information is provided for questions

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

- **Positioning Statement** — informs how to position the replacement solution in
  the transition section
- **Problem Statement** — helps frame the customer impact section with specificity
- **Proto-Persona** — defines the affected customer segments for tailored messaging
- **Press Release** — can be used for the public-facing announcement if the EOL
  is a major product transition
