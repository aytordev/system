# Positioning Statement — Full Framework

## Purpose

The positioning statement is an internal alignment tool, not a tagline or marketing
copy. Write it before any roadmap, press release, or go-to-market plan. It forces
explicit agreement on who you serve, what problem you solve, and why you win. Every
downstream decision — feature priority, messaging, pricing — should be testable
against it.

## Geoffrey Moore's Six-Part Template

```
For [target customer]
who [statement of need or opportunity],
our [product / service name]
is a [product category]
that [statement of key benefit — the compelling reason to buy].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
our product [statement of primary differentiation].
```

Each field requires a specific, falsifiable claim. Generic superlatives ("best",
"fastest", "easiest") are disqualified — they cannot be verified and provide no
alignment value.

## Field-by-Field Guidance

**For [target customer]**
Name the segment at the intersection of firmographic and behavioral criteria.
Include size, role, and context. "Businesses" is not a target customer.

Good: "mid-market SaaS finance teams (50–500 employees)"
Bad: "any company that needs better reporting"

**Who [statement of need or opportunity]**
Describe the specific, painful problem this customer faces — in their language.
Quantify if possible (time lost, errors, cost). Do not describe your solution.

Good: "struggle to close the books in under five days due to manual reconciliation"
Bad: "want better financial software"

**Our [product name] is a [category]**
Name the category you compete in. This anchors buyer mental models and comparison
sets. Picking the wrong category (too broad or too narrow) misaligns expectations.

Good: "financial close automation platform"
Bad: "AI-powered SaaS tool"

**That [key benefit]**
State the primary measurable outcome you deliver. Use numbers where you have them.
This is the reason to buy, not a feature list.

Good: "reduces month-end close time by 40% through automated reconciliation workflows"
Bad: "provides powerful automation features"

**Unlike [primary competitive alternative]**
Name the real alternative buyers use today. This is often a spreadsheet, manual
process, or legacy tool — not always a direct competitor.

Good: "Unlike spreadsheet-based processes and legacy ERP modules"
Bad: "Unlike other software on the market"

**Our product [primary differentiation]**
State the mechanism that delivers your key benefit and that competitors cannot
easily replicate. Avoid feature claims — differentiation is about unique capability
or approach.

Good: "provides real-time audit trails and one-click variance explanations without
requiring IT involvement"
Bad: "has a better user interface and more features"

## Complete Worked Example

```
For mid-market SaaS finance teams (50–500 employees)
who struggle to close the books in under five days,
CloseLoop
is a financial close automation platform
that reduces close time by 40% through automated reconciliation workflows.
Unlike spreadsheet-based processes and legacy ERP modules,
our product provides real-time audit trails and one-click variance explanations
without requiring IT involvement.
```

## Stress-Test Questions

Run these after drafting. A positioning statement that cannot survive all five is
not ready for use.

1. **Specificity test:** Could a competitor claim the exact same statement?
   If yes, the differentiation is insufficiently specific.

2. **Customer recognition test:** Would a target customer read "who [need]" and
   say "that's exactly my problem"? If they shrug, the need is wrong.

3. **Category coherence test:** When a buyer hears the category name, do they know
   what other products they'd compare you to? Confusion means a wrong category.

4. **Falsifiability test:** Can you prove or disprove the key benefit claim with
   data? If not, it's marketing fluff, not positioning.

5. **Decision test:** Can you use this statement to say no to a roadmap item or
   marketing campaign that falls outside it? If the statement cannot exclude things,
   it provides no alignment value.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode              | Symptom                                              | Fix                                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Broad target customer     | "SMBs and enterprises"                               | Pick the beachhead segment you can win first   |
| Aspirational need         | "who want to grow faster"                            | Describe the specific daily pain, not a desire |
| Feature-based key benefit | "that includes 200+ integrations"                    | Name the outcome the integrations produce      |
| Phantom competitor        | "unlike legacy solutions"                            | Name the actual tool they use today            |
| Vague differentiation     | "with a better user experience"                      | Name the specific capability or mechanism      |
| Superlative language      | "the most powerful / easiest / fastest"              | Replace with a measurable, verifiable claim    |

## Usage Protocol

1. Write the first draft alone, then share with stakeholders for reaction — not consensus-building.
2. Treat disagreement as signal: if stakeholders cannot agree on the target customer, the
   strategic decision has not been made yet.
3. Version the document. Date every revision. Never overwrite — old versions reveal strategic drift.
4. Re-evaluate the positioning statement at every significant strategy shift or annual planning cycle.
5. Do not expose it to customers as-is. It is not copywriting. Translate it into messaging later.
