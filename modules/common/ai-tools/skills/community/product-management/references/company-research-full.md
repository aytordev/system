# Company Research — Full Framework

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive company profile that extracts executive insights, product
strategy, transformation initiatives, and organizational dynamics from publicly
available sources. Use this to understand competitive landscape, evaluate
partnership opportunities, benchmark best practices, prepare for interviews, or
inform market entry decisions.

This is strategic intelligence gathering focused on product management perspectives
and executive vision — not surface-level company summaries.

## When to Use

- Competitive analysis (understanding how competitors approach PM)
- Partnership evaluation (assessing cultural fit and strategic direction)
- Interview preparation (understanding company culture and product philosophy)
- Benchmarking best practices (learning from successful companies)
- Market entry decisions (understanding how incumbents operate)

## When NOT to Use

- For internal analysis (this framework is for external research)
- When primary sources are unavailable (executives haven't spoken publicly)
- As a substitute for customer research (this captures company perspective, not customer perspective)

## The Executive Insights Framework

The framework synthesizes company intelligence across seven dimensions:

1. **Company Overview** — basic info, history, industry context
2. **Executive Quotes** — strategic vision from CEO, COO, VP Product, Group PM
3. **Product Insights** — strategy, recent launches, innovation focus
4. **Transformation Strategies** — digital, AI, Agile transformations
5. **Organizational Impact** — how PM influences strategy and cross-functional work
6. **Future Roadmap** — upcoming initiatives and anticipated challenges
7. **Product-Led Growth** — PLG strategies and data-driven decision patterns

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define Research Scope

```
Research Objective
- Company Name: [e.g., "Stripe"]
- Research Purpose: [e.g., "Understand payment platform product strategy"]
- Key Questions:
  - [Question 1]
  - [Question 2]
  - [Question 3]
```

### Step 2: Gather Company Overview

Document basic company information: name, headquarters, industry, founding year,
size (employees, revenue/funding), and key historical milestones.

**Sources:** Company website (About, Press, Blog), LinkedIn company page,
Crunchbase/PitchBook, Wikipedia.

### Step 3: Extract Executive Quotes

Find recent quotes from key executives (CEO, COO, VP Product, Group PM). For
each quote, capture the source link, date, and context.

**Sources:** Earnings call transcripts, podcast interviews (Lenny's Podcast,
Masters of Scale), conference talks, blog posts, LinkedIn posts, industry
publications.

**Quality checks:**
- Prioritize quotes from the last 12-24 months
- Look for strategy/philosophy, not generic PR statements
- Always cite source and date

### Step 4: Document Product Insights

Capture product strategy overview, recent launches with market impact, and
product philosophy (key principles guiding product decisions).

**Sources:** Product blog/changelog, Product Hunt launches, release notes,
product team blog posts or case studies.

### Step 5: Identify Transformation Strategies

Document how the company is evolving across three axes:

- **Digital transformation** — technology modernization, architecture changes
- **AI transformation** — ML/AI integration into core processes and products
- **Agile transformation** — methodology adoption, delivery improvements

**Sources:** Engineering blog, case studies, conference talks by engineering
and product leaders.

### Step 6: Understand PM's Organizational Impact

Document how product management functions within the organization:
- Role in strategic decisions (roadmap ownership, P&L responsibility)
- Cross-functional collaboration patterns (co-location, review cadences)
- PM career paths if available (IC and management tracks)

**Sources:** PM job postings, LinkedIn profiles, PM blog posts, Glassdoor reviews.

### Step 7: Analyze Future Roadmap

Identify where the company is headed: planned initiatives, anticipated market
challenges, and competitive threats.

**Sources:** Earnings calls (forward-looking statements), analyst reports,
industry news.

### Step 8: Document PLG Insights

If applicable, capture product-led growth strategies (self-serve onboarding,
freemium models) and data-driven product decision patterns.

### Step 9: Synthesize Key Takeaways

Summarize strategic principles, product management lessons applicable to your
context, and questions for further research.

## Worked Example (Excerpt)

```
Company Name: Stripe
Research Purpose: Understand payment platform product strategy
Key Questions: Developer experience? Platform extensibility?

Executive Quote (CEO):
"We want to increase the GDP of the internet."
— Patrick Collison, Lenny's Podcast, Sept 2023

Product Insight:
Strategy centers on developer experience — reduce integration complexity,
provide powerful primitives, enable rapid experimentation.

Recent Launch:
Stripe Tax (2021) — automated sales tax calculation. Removed compliance
barrier for global expansion.

Product Philosophy:
Start with developer needs, not enterprise sales. Build for 10x scale
before you need it. Default to public APIs.
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode                | Example                                          | Fix                                                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Surface-level research      | "Stripe is a payments company"                   | Find executive interviews, engineering blogs        |
| No source citations         | "The CEO said the company is focused on X"       | Always cite source and date                         |
| Mixing opinion with facts   | "Their strategy is great because..."             | Document what they do, save analysis for takeaways  |
| Outdated information        | Using 5-year-old quotes                          | Prioritize sources from the last 12-24 months       |
| Ignoring negative signals   | Only documenting successes                       | Include challenges, threats, and acknowledged risks |

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

- **Positioning Statement** — company research informs competitive positioning
- **PESTEL Analysis** — company research feeds market context understanding
- **Proto-Persona** — executive quotes may reveal target persona assumptions
