# Business Health Diagnostic — Full Framework

## Purpose

Diagnose overall SaaS business health by analyzing four dimensions together:
growth, retention, unit economics, and capital efficiency. This is a holistic
diagnostic that connects revenue, retention, economics, and efficiency to reveal
systemic issues and opportunities — not a single-metric check.

Use this to identify problems early, prioritize actions by urgency, and produce
a comprehensive health scorecard for board meetings, quarterly reviews, or
fundraising preparation.

## When to Use

- Preparing for board meetings or investor updates
- Quarterly business reviews (QBR)
- Fundraising preparation (know your numbers before investors ask)
- Annual planning (identify improvement areas)
- You suspect problems but cannot pinpoint them
- New PM or exec joining who needs a health assessment

Do NOT use when pre-revenue (focus on PMF first), in pure research mode (not
enough data), or when you need tactical guidance on a specific topic (use the
dedicated pricing, channel, or feature skills instead).

## The Four-Dimension Framework

### Dimension 1 — Growth and Retention

Metrics: revenue growth rate, NRR, churn rate, Quick Ratio.

Answers the question: are you growing and keeping customers?

### Dimension 2 — Unit Economics

Metrics: CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, payback period, gross margin.

Answers the question: is the business model profitable at the customer level?

### Dimension 3 — Capital Efficiency

Metrics: burn rate, runway, Rule of 40, Magic Number.

Answers the question: are you using cash efficiently?

### Dimension 4 — Strategic Position

Factors: market positioning, competitive moat, revenue concentration risk,
operating leverage.

Answers the question: are you positioned for sustainable success?

## Stage-Specific Benchmarks

### Early Stage (Pre-$10M ARR)

Focus on product-market fit and unit economics. Acceptable: negative margins and
high burn if unit economics work.

| Metric         | Benchmark     |
|----------------|---------------|
| Growth         | >50% YoY      |
| LTV:CAC        | >3:1          |
| Gross Margin   | >70%          |
| Runway         | >12 months    |

### Growth Stage ($10M-$50M ARR)

Focus on scaling efficiently. Acceptable: moderate burn if growth is strong.

| Metric         | Benchmark     |
|----------------|---------------|
| Growth         | >40% YoY      |
| NRR            | >100%         |
| Rule of 40     | >40           |
| Magic Number   | >0.75         |

### Scale Stage ($50M+ ARR)

Focus on profitability and efficiency. Required: positive or near-positive cash
flow.

| Metric         | Benchmark     |
|----------------|---------------|
| Growth         | >25% YoY      |
| NRR            | >110%         |
| Rule of 40     | >40           |
| Profit Margin  | >10%          |

## Red Flag Categories

### Critical (fix immediately)

- Runway <6 months
- LTV:CAC <1.5:1
- Churn accelerating cohort-over-cohort
- NRR <90%
- Magic Number <0.3

### High Priority (fix within the quarter)

- Rule of 40 <25
- Payback >24 months
- Quick Ratio <2
- Gross margin <60%
- Revenue concentration >50% in top 10 customers

### Medium Priority (address within 6 months)

- NRR 90-100% (flat, not growing)
- Magic Number 0.3-0.5
- Operating leverage negative
- Churn rate stable but high (>5% monthly)

## Interactive Diagnostic Process

The diagnostic asks up to 4 adaptive questions, then delivers a comprehensive
health report.

### Step 0 — Gather Context

Collect company stage (pre-$10M, $10M-$50M, $50M+ ARR), business model (PLG,
sales-led, hybrid), and target market (SMB, mid-market, enterprise, mixed).
Benchmarks vary by stage: early-stage optimizes for growth while scale-stage
optimizes for efficiency.

### Step 1 — Growth and Retention Metrics

Collect: current MRR or ARR, revenue growth rate, monthly churn rate, NRR, Quick
Ratio, expansion revenue as percentage of total MRR, and cohort trends
(improving, stable, or degrading).

Evaluate: healthy growth means >40% YoY at growth stage or >25% at scale.
Healthy retention means NRR >100%, churn <5% monthly, Quick Ratio >2.

### Step 2 — Unit Economics Metrics

Collect: CAC (blended or by channel), LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, payback period, gross
margin, contribution margin, and CAC trend (increasing, stable, decreasing).

Evaluate: healthy means LTV:CAC >3:1, payback <12 months, gross margin >70%.
Marginal means LTV:CAC 2-3:1, payback 12-18 months. Poor means LTV:CAC <2:1,
payback >24 months, gross margin <60%.

### Step 3 — Capital Efficiency Metrics

Collect: cash balance, monthly net burn rate, runway, Rule of 40, Magic Number,
S&M as percentage of revenue, R&D as percentage of revenue, whether OpEx is
growing faster than revenue, profit margin, and path to profitability.

Evaluate: healthy means Rule of 40 >40, Magic Number >0.75, runway >12 months.
Poor means Rule of 40 <25, Magic Number <0.5, runway <6 months.

### Step 4 — Deliver Comprehensive Diagnostic

Synthesize all metrics into:

1. Overall Health Score — Healthy, Moderate, Concerning, or Critical
2. Dimension Scores — Growth, Retention, Economics, Efficiency
3. Red Flags — Critical, High Priority, Medium Priority
4. Prioritized Recommendations — Top 3-5 actions with expected impact
5. Stage-Appropriate Benchmarks — How you compare to peers

## Examples

### Healthy Growth-Stage SaaS

ARR $20M, growth 60% YoY, NRR 115%, churn 2.5%, LTV:CAC 4:1, payback 10
months, Rule of 40 = 50, runway 18 months. Diagnosis: Healthy. Scale
aggressively. Key opportunities: expand S&M spend, build upsell paths to push
NRR toward 120%, optimize paid acquisition to reduce CAC.

### Moderate Health (Retention Issue)

ARR $15M, growth 40% YoY, NRR 95%, churn 5%, LTV:CAC 3.5:1, payback 12 months,
Rule of 40 = 38, runway 12 months. Diagnosis: Moderate. Fix retention before
scaling further. Root cause: customers churn before they expand; weak onboarding
and no clear upsell paths. Action: launch onboarding improvement, build premium
tier, reduce churn from 5% to 3.5%.

### Concerning (Multiple Issues)

ARR $8M, growth 25% YoY (slowing), NRR 88%, churn 7% (increasing), LTV:CAC
1.8:1, payback 20 months, Rule of 40 = 15, runway 8 months. Diagnosis:
Concerning. Urgent action needed on retention and unit economics. Stop scaling
acquisition. Fix retention first. Extend runway through cost cuts or emergency
fundraise.

## Common Pitfalls

**Celebrating single metrics.** "Revenue growing 50%!" while ignoring burn,
churn, and unit economics leads to unsustainable growth. Always look at all four
dimensions together.

**Ignoring stage-specific benchmarks.** An early-stage company not being
profitable is normal. A scale-stage company burning cash without growth is a
crisis. Use stage-appropriate benchmarks.

**Focusing only on lagging indicators.** By the time churn and NRR show problems,
it is late. Track leading indicators: usage, engagement, onboarding completion.

**Not acting on red flags.** "NRR <100% for 3 quarters, but we will fix it
eventually." Problems compound. Set clear timelines. If a metric does not improve
in X time, escalate.

**Trying to fix everything at once.** Resources spread thin and nothing improves.
Prioritize top 1-3 issues and fix them sequentially.
