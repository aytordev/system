## Compare Approaches

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Compare multiple approaches in a structured table format. Include at least 2 options when possible.

### Analysis Format

Present options as a table:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Complexity |
|----------|------|------|------------|
| Option A | {benefits} | {drawbacks} | {low/medium/high} |
| Option B | {benefits} | {drawbacks} | {low/medium/high} |

### What to Compare

1. **Implementation approaches**:
   - Different architectural patterns
   - Alternative libraries/tools
   - Varying levels of scope

2. **Evaluation criteria**:
   - Alignment with existing patterns
   - Complexity and maintainability
   - Performance implications
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Risk level

3. **Trade-offs**:
   - Time vs quality
   - Flexibility vs simplicity
   - Local change vs systemic refactor

### Rules

- Always present at least 2 viable options (even if one is clearly better)
- Be specific about pros/cons — avoid vague statements
- Quantify complexity honestly (don't downplay difficult approaches)
- Note which approach aligns best with existing codebase patterns
