## Color & Theme

**Impact:** HIGH

Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Vary between light and dark themes. NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds).

**Incorrect:**

**The "AI Default"**
Using a white background (`#ffffff`) with a generic primary blue/purple (`#6366f1`) and dark grey text. This signals "unbranded prototype" immediately.

**Correct:**

**Cohesive Atmosphere**
Define a palette where the background and text interact to create a mood, not just contrast. Use slightly tinted blacks or whites.

_Example Concept: "Midnight Rust"_

- **Background**: Warm, deep charcoal (not pure black).
- **Text**: Off-white/Bone (softer than pure white).
- **Primary Accent**: International Safety Orange (high energy, restricted usage).
- **Secondary Accent**: Warm Grey (supporting structure).
- **Result**: Feels industrial, warm, and sophisticated.
