## Atmospheric Details

**Impact:** HIGH

Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

**Incorrect:**

**Flat Surfaces**
Using plain solid colors for backgrounds and cards. The interface feels paper-thin and digital-default.

**Correct:**

**Texture & Depth**
Layer visual elements to create a sense of material or space.

- **Noise/Grain**: Overlay a subtle static noise texture to soften digital sharpness.
- **Lighting**: Use radial gradients to simulate a light source (vignette), drawing focus to the center.
- **Blur**: Use backdrop-blur on overlay elements to create a "frosted glass" depth.
- **Borders**: Instead of a 1px solid border, try a semi-transparent white border that looks like a highlight catching the edge of glass.
