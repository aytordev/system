## Establish Creative Direction

**Impact:** CRITICAL

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction. Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**Incorrect:**

**Generic/Vague**
Make a modern, clean landing page for a SaaS product.

**Correct:**

**Specific/Bold**
Design a brutalist, industrial landing page. Use raw layout lines, monospace typography (JetBrains Mono), and high-contrast black and electric blue (#00F0FF). The interface should feel like a technical blueprint or terminal, with grid-breaking heavy borders and rigid spacing.
