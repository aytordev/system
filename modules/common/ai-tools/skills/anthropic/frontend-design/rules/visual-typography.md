## Typography Choices

**Impact:** HIGH

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

**Incorrect:**

**Generic Default**
Relying on system fonts or ubiquitous, neutral sans-serifs (like Inter or Roboto) without intent. This creates a "generic template" feel.

**Correct:**

**Intentional Pairing**
Select a display font with strong personality (e.g., an expressive serif, a brutalist mono, or a high-contrast geometric sans) for headings. Pair it with a highly legible but distinct body font.

_Example Pairing:_

- **Headings**: _Syne_ (Art-house, wide distinct curves)
- **Body**: _Space Grotesk_ (Technical, monospace-inspired sans)
- **Effect**: Creates a "Gallery/Tech" atmosphere rather than a "Std Admin Dashboard" look.
