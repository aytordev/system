## Spatial Composition

**Impact:** HIGH

Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density. Avoid predictable layouts.

**Incorrect:**

**Standard Container**
Centering everything in a standard 1200px container with consistent padding. Header centered, Subtext centered, 3-column grid below. It looks like a template.

**Correct:**

**Dynamic Tension**
Break the grid to create visual interest.

- **Asymmetry**: Place a massive headline on the left, but balance it with a small, dense block of technical text on the far bottom-right.
- **Overlap**: Allow images to drift behind text, or text to overlap borders.
- **Whitespace**: Leave 40% of the screen empty to give the remaining elements monumental weight.
- **Scale**: Contrast tiny meta-data (10px) with enormous display text (120px).
