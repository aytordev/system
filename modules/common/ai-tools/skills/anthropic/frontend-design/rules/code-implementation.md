## Implementation Quality

**Impact:** MEDIUM

Implement real working code that is production-grade, functional, and meticulously refined. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimalist designs need restraint/precision. Avoid cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

**Incorrect:**

**MVP/Prototype Quality**
Code that technically "works" but lacks polish—jumpy transitions, default browser focus rings, unstyled loading states, or poor responsiveness on mobile.

**Correct:**

**Production Craftsmanship**
The implementation creates a seamless, app-like feel regardless of the technology stack.

- **Interaction State**: Every interactive element has defined hover, focus, active, and disabled states.
- **Accessibility**: Focus indicators are styled to match the theme but remain high-contrast. Semantic HTML is used for structure.
- **Resilience**: Layouts adapt fluidly to any screen size, not just rigid breakpoints. Text doesn't overflow containers when content changes.
