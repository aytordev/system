## Motion & Interactivity

**Impact:** HIGH

Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

**Incorrect:**

**Static or jarring**
Elements appear instantly upon load, or everything animates chaotically at the same time. Hover states are limited to simple color changes.

**Correct:**

**Choreographed & Fluid**
Orchestrate entrances so the user is guided through the content.

_Example Choreography:_

1.  **Stage**: Layout loads invisibly.
2.  **Act 1 (0ms)**: Main headline rises from below with a heavy ease-out.
3.  **Act 2 (+100ms)**: Navigation fades in from top.
4.  **Act 3 (+200ms)**: Content cards cascade in one by one (staggered delay).
5.  **Interaction**: Cards don't just change color on hover—they lift (scale up), cast a deeper shadow, and perhaps reveal secondary information.
